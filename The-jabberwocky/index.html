<p><pre>
&apos;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe.
</pre></p>

<p ><pre>
<q>Beware the Jabberwock, my son
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
    The frumious Bandersnatch!</q>
</pre></p>  

<p><pre>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
    And burbled as it came!</pre></p>

<p><pre>
One, two! One, two! And through and through
    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
    He went galumphing back.
</pre></p>

<p text-align: center><pre>
<q>And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!</q>
    He chortled in his joy.
</pre></p>  

<p><pre>
&apos;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
     And the mome raths outgrabe.
    </pre></p>
